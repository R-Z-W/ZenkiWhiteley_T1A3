<h3>Using Custom Data</h3>

To Use Custom Data In This Application, Files Must Follow A Specific Criteria In-order For The Application To Run.
Once Created These Custom Datas Are Placed In The Root Folder Of The Application.
This Application Accepts 2 Types Of Custom Data. These Are:

<h4>Log Files</h4>

Log Files Must Be .txt Files.<br>
The Name Convention For The File Must Start With ```Log```<br>
An Example Of An Acceptable Name: ```LogWordsNumbersHere.txt```<br>
Example Of Log File Content:

```
#Place Record Details Here.
#Large(Van, Truck, FullSizeSuv) Medium(Suv, Sedan, SingleCabUte) Small(Compact,Hatchback)
Recorded_Date: 18/12/2023
Recorded_Large_Car: 6
Recorded_Medium_Car: 4
Recorded_Small_Car: 2
#Place Used Products Here.
Earplugs: 5
nitrate gloves: 25														
denatured alcochol: 176
Thinners: 12
```

Log Files Contain 3 Different Types of Data. These Are:
- Comments 
    - Starting with ```#```, these are ignored by the Application allowing for notes to be stored in the log files.
- Recorded & Values
    - Case sensitive ```Recorded``` can be placed in front of data names that the Application will display. 
    - This type of data must have a ```:``` in-order to distinguish between name and value in the Application.
    - <b>!Important!</b> Every log file must have a date, e.g. ```Recorded_Date: 18/12/2023``` in-order for the Application to function properly.
- Names & Values
    - Names can be anything from strings to words and numbers.
    - Values must be numbers that represent the amount of product used on the day.
    - Names and Values must have a ```:``` in-order to distinguish between them in the Application.


<h4>Databases</h4>

A Database File Must Be .csv File.<br>
Database Files Can Have Any Name<br>
An Example Of An Acceptable Name: ```DatabaseName.csv```<br>
The Values Inside A Database File, Must Be Seperated by a ```,```<br>
Example Of Database Content:

```
Name,Category,OverallPrice,UnitQuantity,Extra,UnitPrice,Ratio,InUse,SingleUse
